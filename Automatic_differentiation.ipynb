In this algorithm, parameters (model weights) are adjusted according to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the given parameter. The loss function calulates the difference between the expected output and the actual output that a neural network produces. The goal is to get the result of the loss function as close to zero as possible. The algorithm traverses backwards through the neural network to adjust the weights and bias to retrain the model. That's why it's called back propagation.
